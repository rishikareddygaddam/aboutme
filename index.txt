I am a first semester graduate student at Northwest Missouri state University, pursuing Master of Science in Applied Computer Science.

I am from Hyderabad and I have a work experience of 18 months in Accenture where I worked as SAP Business Warehouse (BW) consultant and SAP UI5 consultant. I did my under-graduation in Information Technology  at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology which is the top private college in Telangana State.

My hobbies are playing sports, indoor games, reading novels(The Monk who sold his Ferrari is my favorite).

 

I am looking forward to see myself as an initiator of a company where I would like to take the lead of technical team and introduce innovative products to the world. Hence, I would like to utilize the resources available at the Northwest Missouri state university to the full and reach my goals.
